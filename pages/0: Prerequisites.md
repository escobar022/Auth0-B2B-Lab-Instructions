# Welcome to the Auth0 B2B SaaS Lab!

In order to set you up for success, we need a few things in place before we can start:

- Please register a new tenant on https://auth0.com. You won't need to provide anything but an email and a password, which will give you a free Auth0 tenant with a 3 week enterprise trial enabled (which includes features we will use throughout the lab). We would recommend to set up the tenant in the Europe region.

- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download the framework here: https://nodejs.org.

- Make sure you have a code editor ready. We will use Visual Studio Code for the live coding, but any other editor that you feel comfortable with should be good as well.
